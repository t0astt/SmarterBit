# SmarterBit
SmarterBit is an XPosed Framework module and frontend application designed to add functionality to the FitBit Charge and Charge HR fitness trackers.

Please note that I no longer maintain this app, thus I am open sourcing it. At the time it was just an experiment, and due to work and life changes I no longer have the time to maintain or further develop this. At the time of this writing (10/1/2016) it does not work with the current Fitbit versions, therefore some heavy modifications will need to be made if this is ever to be made working again.
